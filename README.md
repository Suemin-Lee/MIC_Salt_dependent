# **MIC Salt Dependent**

This repository contains the code for computing the total free energy with the simplified versions of electrostatic binding energy and mapping to the Langmuir model to find MIC (minimum inhibitor concentration). 

Here, we used two different methods: 1. Direct Substitution methods, 2. Minimization Method. 
To see the full result of MIC using either method, please run the file of the `Electrostatic_Energy_Direct_Subsitution.ipynb` or the `Electrostatic_Energy_Minimization.ipynb`.
